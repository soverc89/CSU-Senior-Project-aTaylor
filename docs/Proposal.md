Problem Statement
-----------------

When planning a hunting trip, success is never guaranteed. Hunters face the uncertainty of whether they
will even see an animal, much less harvest one. The challenge lies in the unpredictable nature of wildlife,
making it dificult to ensure a sucessful hunt. Although no hunting strategy can guarantee results, hunters can 
increase their chances of encountering game by carefully selecting ideal weather conditions.


Project Description
-------------------

This project will collect and analyze weather data, primarily wind data, to 
determine the best times and locations to hunt in a given area set by the user.


Proposed Implementation Language(s) 
-----------------------------------

Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQLite


Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc., to be used in the proposed implementation language(s)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flask, MapBox JS, Requests, Pure.css, Bootstrap, Node.JS


Additional Software/Equipment Needed
------------------------------------


Alternative Solutions and Rationale 🔍
--------------------------------------

> **Purpose**: Describe at least two alternative solutions or approaches to your project. Compare these with your chosen solution based on relevant criteria (e.g., feasibility, scalability, cost, performance, usability). Explain why you selected your final approach.

### Alternative 1
  Physical Weather Station
- **Description**:  
  This alternative would use a pre-built or custom-built weather station in order to collect real-time weather data instead of relying on weather data APIs.
  
- **Pros**:  
  - _(List strengths or advantages)_
  - Very accurate local weather readings
  - Less reliant on APIs
  - Cool Factor
- **Cons**:  
  - _(List weaknesses or limitations)_
  - Weather readings are only accurate within a certain radius of the station.
  - Scalibility is limited by needing physical weather stations at each location.
  - Maintenance / Troubleshooting of the weather station hardware.
  - Weather stations at geographically remote hunting locations are less feasible
  - Communicating with a station is limited to LoRaWAN and or Satelite data transfer, effecting performance and cost.
### Alternative 2
  Meteor Tech Stack
- **Description**:
  This alternative proposes using the Meteor framework, a all in one JavaScript stack, to build the web application instead of a   Python based stack.
  
- **Pros**:  
  - _(List strengths or advantages)_
  - Frontend, Backend, and database are integrated together
  - Data syncrhonization/Live updates are built in.
- **Cons**:  
  - _(List weaknesses or limitations)_
  - Spotty development could lead to future issues with scalabiliity
  - Meteor has a small userbase, less online guides and documentation
  - Less flexible, forced to use the conventions of the Meteor framework

### Chosen Solution and Rationale
- **Chosen Solution**:  
  _(Restate your selected solution.)_
- **Rationale**:  
  _(Justify your choice in comparison with the alternatives. Highlight key reasons for its selection.)_

> 💡 *Tip: Consider using a comparison table to evaluate trade-offs across multiple criteria such as feasibility, performance, scalability, cost, and usability.*


Personal Motivation
-------------------

I deer hunt during the spring/winter and there is always a lot of planning that
goes into each aspect of a hunt. Planning a successful hunt relies on having 
a variety of up to date and accurate information.
