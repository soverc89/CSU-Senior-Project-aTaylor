Problem Statement
-----------------

When planning a hunting trip, there is no sure fire way to ensure you will see
anything, much less ensure you will be able to harvest an animal. At most you can 
increase your odds. One of the best ways to increase your odds of encountering
an animal is to choose ideal weather conditions.


Project Description
-------------------

This project will collect and analyze weather data, primarily wind data, to 
determine the best hunting locations in a given area.


Proposed Implementation Language(s) 
-----------------------------------

Still Determining:
Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Meteor


Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc., to be used in the proposed implementation language(s)

Alternative Solutions and Rationale 🔍
--------------------------------------

> **Purpose**: Describe at least two alternative solutions or approaches to your project. Compare these with your chosen solution based on relevant criteria (e.g., feasibility, scalability, cost, performance, usability). Explain why you selected your final approach.

### Alternative 1
- **Description**:  
  Meteor Stack
- **Pros**:  
  - _(List strengths or advantages)_
- **Cons**:  
  - _(List weaknesses or limitations)_

### Alternative 2
- **Description**:  
  _(Briefly describe this solution or approach.)_
- **Pros**:  
  - _(List strengths or advantages)_
- **Cons**:  
  - _(List weaknesses or limitations)_

### Chosen Solution and Rationale
- **Chosen Solution**:  
  _(Restate your selected solution.)_
- **Rationale**:  
  _(Justify your choice in comparison with the alternatives. Highlight key reasons for its selection.)_

> 💡 *Tip: Consider using a comparison table to evaluate trade-offs across multiple criteria such as feasibility, performance, scalability, cost, and usability.*


Personal Motivation
-------------------

I deer hunt during the spring/winter and there is always a lot of planning that
goes into each aspect of a hunt. Planning a successful hunt relies on having 
a variety of up to date and accurate information.
