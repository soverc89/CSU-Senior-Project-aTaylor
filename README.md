# Hunting Stand Weather Project

This project is a web application built with Python and flask, and designed to help hunters increase their success by selecting the best stand location for current weather conditions. The application takes user defined stand location data and compares it against real time weather data fetched from weather APIs. Its main function is computing the optimal stand choice by calculating the difference between stand and wind direction. The results are rendered in a "dashboard", allowing the users to easily visualize the most optimal stand in a location to hunt at.
